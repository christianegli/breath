## 🎯 Project Mission

Help users safely improve their breath-holding capacity through scientifically-proven methods while prioritizing education and safety above all else.

## 🚀 Key Features

### MVP (Core Functionality)
- **Safety Education Module**: Mandatory safety training before app usage
- **Guided Breathing Techniques**: Box breathing and diaphragmatic breathing tutorials
- **Progressive Dry Training**: Structured beginner-to-intermediate programs
- **Smart Timer**: Audio/visual cues for training sessions
- **Progress Tracking**: Safe metrics and improvement monitoring
- **Medical Disclaimers**: Comprehensive safety warnings and contraindications

### Future Enhancements

- **Clear warnings** about dangerous techniques (hyperventilation, Wim Hof for breath-holding)
- **Dry training focus** (safer than water-based practice)
- **Medical disclaimers** and professional consultation recommendations
- **Age-appropriate restrictions** and parental controls

## 🔬 Research-Based Methods

Built on scientifically-proven techniques:
- CO2 tolerance training (safe, progressive)
- Static apnea protocols from freediving experts
- Diaphragmatic breathing for efficiency
- Progressive overload principles

## 🏗️ Tech Stack
